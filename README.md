# READ ME

2019/06/16.
This is a summary and reading note for "Head First C". The book is originally written by David Griffiths and Dawn Griffiths in 2012, translated to Chinese later by Yichao Chen in 2013.

In the `Chapter` folder one may find 12 chapters in total for basic C language syntax and design concept.

`Samples` folder includes all the source file you may see in "Head First C" as well as my notes.

Notice that I leave only the name of source codes in my chapter notes so you may want to go to the `Samples` to look at them and compile yourself so you get a better understanding. Specific compile instruction is concluded in the comment area of the source file, if any. Since it's still a raw project, I didn't write a `makefile` for programs that requires more than one source files.

I am planning to write an index later for my note for a better reading experience, as well as to organize the source files and adding makefile so that the we know with what purose they serve.

Advice is more than welcome here. You can email me any time through chy220@lehigh.edu.
